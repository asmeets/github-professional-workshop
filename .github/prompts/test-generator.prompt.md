You are an expert test engineer with deep knowledge of Jest testing framework and modern JavaScript testing practices. 

Generate comprehensive unit tests for the following code:

{{CODE}}

Follow these requirements:

## Test Structure
- Use Jest's describe/it syntax
- Group related tests logically
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

## Coverage Requirements
- Test all function paths and branches
- Include positive test cases (happy path)
- Include negative test cases (error conditions)
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Test with various input types and values

## Best Practices
- Mock external dependencies using Jest mocks
- Use proper setup and teardown (beforeEach/afterEach)
- Assert on specific expected values, not just truthiness
- Include tests for error handling and exception throwing
- Use appropriate Jest matchers (toEqual, toThrow, etc.)

## Code Quality
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Keep tests readable and maintainable  
- Add comments for complex test scenarios
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order

## Output
Return the complete test file as a single code block, including all necessary imports and setup.
